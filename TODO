- merge all Logic to work with the new accessor tables
- rename User(Service|Dao|Controller) to Access*
- all BOs should get an Accessor object

- no moneyflows must be createable before the current group assignment was valid
  (no moneyflows for the previous group after the group assignment changed)

3. move coreSettings-stuff to REST
4. redo the user handling
5. implement Logout Call to destroy the session on the server.

further thoughts:
   - consider Conductor handling for showEdit*... -> edit* -> Error -> re-use the showEdit functionality
   - maybe extra Validator Classes with insert/update/delete relevant validations and not in the Service
   - centralize all cachenames

What is currently missing:

 - good User/Group handling (users cannot assigned to groups)
 - Posting Accounts cannot be listed, edited, deleted, added
 - PredefMoneyflows can not be assigned with default Posting Accounts

Bugs detected so far:
   - predefmoneyflows: edit moneyflow with out-of-daterange capitalsource - do not allow to save it!
   - when a new month start and after the login the settlement question is raised - the new window should open in the
     correct size (height = NUM_SOURCES * 35+something)
   - moneyflows for capitalsources which are not allowed for the user must not be possible (verify this with RESTClient,
     the Client does not allow it already)
   - MonthlySettlements - create for a far month in the future - check if the propper capitalsources are selected. All capitalsources
     which are valid with at least one day in this month have to be selected (valid only at the beginning, only at the end for example)
     check this.....
   - when reassigning a user from group a to group b ask:
      - also copy capitalsources?

New Installation
   - check that after the first logon, on a clean DB, the password has to be changed first
   - "No monthly settlement for the previous month exists. Do you want to create it now?" - it makes no sense without a capitalsource
   - assume for new capitalsources always "0" as the previous month settlement
   - user handling must be migrated completly to REST, otherwise the first logon triggers a password change, and then sets
     back the att_new. But this setting back happens in coreUsers but is not in the cache on the REST-Server
   - Trend does not work - maybe because no settlement done yet?

- evaluate:
  - Redis / Predis
  - Doctrine + Serializer
  - PHPUnit
    -> PHP_CodeCoverage needed
    -> Xdebug needed (drops performance heavily)
    ---> not sure if OK

some far time in the future:

- 666. Redo the Webclient MVC like
- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable
