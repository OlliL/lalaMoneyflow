- trend: make specific capitalsources select- and deselectable not just
  "all" and one specific - either do this by having a multiple select
  box, or by showing all of them and having check boxes...
- capitalsources unique key might be wrong - there need to be a key with
  valid_from in it - right now ownly one comment is allowed - when it gets
  invalid by valid_til - no new capitalsource with the same name may be
  created
- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable
