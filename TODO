4. implement Logout Call to destroy the session on the server.

5. continue removing Core Classes
   - move calc_amount to the client (for the time being, the personal Currency handling is broken)
   - think about language handling - it is no longer DB backed but cache backed in files
   - maybe extra Validator Classes with insert/update/delete relevant validations and not in the Service
   - centralize all cachenames
   - think about removing "movement_calculated" from monthlysettlements since we now have caching

Bugs detected so far:
   - predefmoneyflows: edit moneyflow with out-of-daterange capitalsource - do not allow to save it!
   - when a new month start and after the login the settlement question is raised - the new window should open in the
     correct size (height = NUM_SOURCES * 35+something)
   - moneyflows for capitalsources which are not allowed for the user must not be possible (verify this with RESTClient,
     the Client does not allow it already)
   - MonthlySettlements - create for a far month in the future - check if the propper capitalsources are selected. All capitalsources
     which are valid with at least one day in this month have to be selected (valid only at the beginning, only at the end for example)
     check this.....

New Installation
   - check that after the first logon, on a clean DB, the password has to be changed first
   - "No monthly settlement for the previous month exists. Do you want to create it now?" - it makes no sense without a capitalsource
   - assume for new capitalsources always "0" as the previous month settlement
   - user handling must be migrated completly to REST, otherwise the first logon triggers a password change, and then sets
     back the att_new. But this setting back happens in coreUsers but is not in the cache on the REST-Server
   - Trend does not work - maybe because no settlement done yet?

- evaluate:
  - Doctrine + Serializer
  - PHPUnit
    -> PHP_CodeCoverage needed
    -> Xdebug needed (drops performance heavily)
    ---> not sure if OK



some far time in the future:
666. Redo the Webclient MVC like

New User/Group handling concept:

- user and groups share the same ID pool and are just differentiated by priority levels (user ID has a higher priority than group ID)
	- Migration:
		- create one group for user 1 and user 2 and assign it to them
		- move user 2 to the group of user 1 beginning of 2012
- moneyflows are maintained on group IDs (generall access for all members) and private ones on user IDs (only shown to the user itself)
	- Migration:
		- update moneyflows set new-id = group-id where private != 1;
		- update moneyflows set new-id = user-id where private = 1;
- contractparter are always maintained on group IDs
- predefmoneyflows can be maintained on group or user level and are shown then to the whole group or only to the user (change creation+update screens)
	- Migration:
		- move all predefmoneyflows to the user-Level
- contractparter will have to get validfrom/validtil fields
	- Migration:
		- move all existing contractpartner to the user groups of user 1 and user 2
		- migrate all existing moneyflows of user 2 after 01.01.2012 (new group assignment) to the contractpartner of the new assigned group.
		- migrate all existing predefmoneyflows to the new contractpartner for user 2
		- invalidate all contractpartners which where not used in the past 2 or 3 years
- the contractpartner list screen will get a functionality to re-activate deactivated contractpartners and to deactivate contractpartners.
- settlements are also always maintained on group level
- capitalsources are also maintained on group level, and the "group usage allowed" still applies (they'll be seen by all, but used only by
  the creator except "group usage allowed" is flagged)
- capitalsources will have two ID fields one "creator" and one "assigned" ID

- questions:
	- what if user 2 edits a group-assigned moneyflow where user 1 has created it with a capitalsource user 2 has no permission to use?
	
		 



old (but maybe still valid) TODOs:

  
- create group-mantainance screens 

  - add user to group(s)
  - remove user from group(s)
    -> in the Users view. When adding or editing user, show two List-of value
       boxes. One on the right of the groups where the user is assigned to, and
       on the left a box with the groups where the user is not assigned to. Make
       butons to move a group from left to right and vice versa.

- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable

- what has to happen to monthlysettlements.movement_calulated if a new
  currency rate gets valid for the currency the users has chosen to
  display but is different from the currency rate which is stored in
  the DB
    -> field must be recalculated?
    -> why is the shown field saved not the field in the DB currency? is this
       is really the case?
