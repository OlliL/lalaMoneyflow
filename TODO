update contractpartners set validtil='2014-12-31' where contractpartnerid in (select mcp_contractpartnerid from (select max(bookingdate) max_bookingdate,mcp_contractpartnerid from moneyflows where mcp_contractpartnerid in (select contractpartnerid from contractpartners where now() between validfrom and validtil) group by mcp_contractpartnerid) a where max_bookingdate < date_sub(now(), interval 600 day));

- when processing an imported moneyflow where "other" is also a capitalsource of the user, also add a counter booking
  automatically to this capitalsource (like -1000 EUR capitalsource 1 if a moneyflow "+1000 EUR" for capitalsource 2
  was imported).

- when adding a booking manually which gets imported later, try to match it and mark it as "to be deleted" or something like that....

- PHPUnit: start writing service tests
- PHPDoc: document the services, then the controller, then the DAOs, and maybe the BOs
- check.php: distinguish between client and server dependencies
- sorting - small letters after big letters (Contract partners dropdown) is bad....
- check if chache engine works (not just if it is installed, e.g. redis server is started up...)
