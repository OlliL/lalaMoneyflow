- do not allow the admin features when the user is no admin

- when deleting a user permit it if the user still owns data

- make it possible to delete a user recursive (CASCADE) possibly with a stored procedure

- when att_new is set for a user the user has to change the password on logon.

- capitalsources ENUMs localizable (probably via 'text' and different types)

- admin tool
  - language handling (change translation, add new language) (?)
