feature requests:
- when a booking was added manually and the same booking gets imported later, try to match it and mark it as "to be deleted" or something like that....

- import monthly settlements:
  - change the add-monthly-settlement form to also support "complete monthly settlement"
    - display two parts. upper part: not existing monthly settlements
    - lower part: existing (imported) monthly settlements
  - when clicking on "add" don't show the first next month without any monthly settlement but the next month with not a complete set of settlements
  - when logging in, do not check if for the previous month a settlement was created but if a complete set of settlements exists
  - add a REST resource which can import monthly settlements by accountnumber/bankcode of a capitalsource


lower prio TODOs:
- PHPUnit: start writing service tests
- PHPDoc: document the services, then the controller, then the DAOs, and maybe the BOs
- check.php: distinguish between client and server dependencies
- check if chache engine works (not just if it is installed, e.g. redis server is started up...)

assorted:
- update contractpartners set validtil='2014-12-31' where contractpartnerid in (select mcp_contractpartnerid from (select max(bookingdate) max_bookingdate,mcp_contractpartnerid from moneyflows where mcp_contractpartnerid in (select contractpartnerid from contractpartners where now() between validfrom and validtil) group by mcp_contractpartnerid) a where max_bookingdate < date_sub(now(), interval 600 day));
