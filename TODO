- add functionality to add, modify, delete contractpartneraccounts

- create a new entity "HBCI import"
- add the functionality to check on each login if data is there for the accounts the user has access to
- if data is there - display it and let the user do the following things:
  - add booking account information (maybe also make a "preselection" maintainable per contract partner
  - add comment
  - dropdownbox "contractpartner" with preselection if IBAN is in the system
  - checkbox "save IBAN to selected contractpartner"
  - [Import] button
  - [Skip] button
 
 -  create a new REST interface where lalaMoneyflowHBCI can push its HBCI data to which will fill the new "HBCI import" entity
 
 
 


- create predefined-moneyflows out of moneyflows in the reports-view
- schedule predefined moneyflows (automatically create every .... )


- PHPUnit: start writing service tests
- PHPDoc: document the services, then the controller, then the DAOs, and maybe the BOs
- check.php: distinguish between client and server dependencies
- sorting - small letters after big letters (Contract partners dropdown) is bad....
- check if chache engine works (not just if it is installed, e.g. redis server is started up...)
