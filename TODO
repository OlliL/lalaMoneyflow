- admin tool
  - currency handling (add, change, make default)
  - language handling (change translation, add new language) (?)
- when deleting a user permit it if the user still owns data
- make it possible to delete a user recursive (CASCADE)
- when att_new is set for a user the user has to change the password on logon.
- capitalsources ENUMs localizable
- currency handling must be rethought - enter stuff in DM, gets saved as EUR,
  and what is when then the rate EUR<->DM changes? When the user paid 20 DM
  he paid 20 DM, even when the rate changes later...
  probably solution -> validfrom/validtil for currencies (rate....)
