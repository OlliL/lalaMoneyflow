when adding a settlement, do not switch into the "edit" mode when changing the
date. this prevents adding a settlement for a month in a previous year, when
for the same month this year a settlement already exists. (change month, you'll
get the "edit" mode for the current year and can't leave)
maybe just display the navigation drop down boxes all the time...?

do not allow to add moneyflows with sources when they are not valid on the added
date

when changing the date during adding a settlement, the hidden REFERER variable
gets wrong

when adding a monthly settlement with an error, do not insert any settlement

- language handling (change translation, add new language) (?)
