1. remove Core Classes
   - implement REST/JSON Services + use them
     - first complete Capitalsource and Contractpartner Handling so Caching can be enabled for them
     - then complete Moneflow Handling so Caching can be enabled as well
   - move calc_amount to the client (for the time being, the personal Currency handling is broken)
   - store translateable text on the client not in the DB as this is client data

some far time in the future:
2. Redo the Webclient MVC like






  
- create group-mantainance screens 

  - add user to group(s)
  - remove user from group(s)
    -> in the Users view. When adding or editing user, show two List-of value
       boxes. One on the right of the groups where the user is assigned to, and
       on the left a box with the groups where the user is not assigned to. Make
       butons to move a group from left to right and vice versa.

- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable

- what has to happen to monthlysettlements.movement_calulated if a new
  currency rate gets valid for the currency the users has chosen to
  display but is different from the currency rate which is stored in
  the DB
    -> field must be recalculated?
    -> why is the shown field saved not the field in the DB currency? is this
       is really the case?
