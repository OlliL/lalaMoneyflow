0. validatuib for PreDefMoneyflows on serverside (reduce client side afterwards)

1. implement the remaining coreMoneyflows on Serverside.

2. implement Logout Call to destroy the session on the server.

3. continue removing Core Classes
   - implement REST/JSON Services + use them
   - move calc_amount to the client (for the time being, the personal Currency handling is broken)
   - think about language handling - it is no longer DB backed but cache backed in files
   - maybe extra Validator Classes with insert/update/delete relevant validations and not in the Service
   - centralize all cachenames

Bugs detected so far:
   - predefmoneyflows: edit moneyflow with out-of-daterange capitalsource - do not allow to save it!
   - when a new month start and after the login the settlement question is raised - the new window should open in the
     correct size (height = NUM_SOURCES * 35+something)
   - when deleting a Capitalsource it is not checked if it is still in use in "predefmoneyflows"
   - moneyflows for capitalsources which are not allowed for the user must not be possible (verify this with RESTClient,
     the Client does not allow it already)
   - capitalsources without comment must not be created.
     

- evaluate:
  - Doctrine + Serializer
  - PHPUnit
    -> PHP_CodeCoverage needed
    -> Xdebug needed (drops performance heavily)
    ---> not sure if OK



some far time in the future:
666. Redo the Webclient MVC like

old (but still valid) TODOs:

  
- create group-mantainance screens 

  - add user to group(s)
  - remove user from group(s)
    -> in the Users view. When adding or editing user, show two List-of value
       boxes. One on the right of the groups where the user is assigned to, and
       on the left a box with the groups where the user is not assigned to. Make
       butons to move a group from left to right and vice versa.

- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable

- what has to happen to monthlysettlements.movement_calulated if a new
  currency rate gets valid for the currency the users has chosen to
  display but is different from the currency rate which is stored in
  the DB
    -> field must be recalculated?
    -> why is the shown field saved not the field in the DB currency? is this
       is really the case?
