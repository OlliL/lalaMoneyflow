- Add a comparsion tool
  - goal: easily detect not entered or wrongly entered data for electronic money transfer

  - you upload a file and specify which format it has (for example PostBank online banking export file)
  - you select a timeframe to check

  - the tool will then try to find the movements specified in that file in moneyflows for the specified timeframe

  - the toll will show:
     - all movements from the file which couldn't be looked up in moneyflows
     - all movements in moneyflows which couldn't be looked up in the file
     - if the datasets which could have been matched, the differences between if they are existent for example
       - bookingdate
       - amount(?)

  - thinkings:
    - how to match the data from the file with the data in moneyflows
      - not sure if the contractpartner can be looked up to find which one sounds most right for matching - if it is given in the file at all!
        (for example the imported file says "HIT MARKT" and moneyflows only knows "HIT" - maybe a "most matching entry" function exists - evaluating needed)
    - what to do if an entry still matches 2 or more other entries - let the user at first clarify the unclarified entries before showing the result?
    - what to do if the result still contains wrongly matched transactions?
    - the input format of the file has to be configureable at first the following should be enough:
      - beginning of the line which indicates that the list begins
      - the delimiter between the "columns" in the file
      - the column position of the amount
      - the column position of the contractpartner (if available!)
   
- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable
