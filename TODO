- admin tool
  - user handling (add, change, delete)
  - currency handling (add, change, make default)
  - language handling (change translation, add new language) (?)
- capitalsources ENUMs localizable
- currency handling must be rethought - enter stuff in DM, gets saved as EUR,
  and what is when then the rate EUR<->DM changes? When the user paid 20 DM
  he paid 20 DM, even when the rate changes later...
  probably solution -> validfrom/validtil for currencies (rate....)
