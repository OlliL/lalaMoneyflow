- do not allow the admin features when the user is no admin

- copy system settings when creating a new user

- when deleting a user permit it if the user still owns data

- make it possible to delete a user recursive (CASCADE) possibly with a stored procedure

- when att_new is set for a user the user has to change the password on logon.

- currency handling must be rethought - enter stuff in DM, gets saved as EUR,
  and what is when then the rate EUR<->DM changes? When the user paid 20 DM
  he paid 20 DM, even when the rate changes later...
  probably solution -> validfrom/validtil for currencies (rate....)

- capitalsources ENUMs localizable (probably via 'text' and different types)

- jpgraph localizeable

- admin tool
  - currency handling (add, change, make default)
  - language handling (change translation, add new language) (?)
