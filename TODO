General idea for groups is:

- see moneyflows for other users in the same group (but not add, change or delete)
- create group-mantainance screens (add group, delete group, modify group, add user to groups, remove user from groups)



- put the available countries into the db and have them selectable when
  handling contractual partners instead of having it free editable
- what has to happen to monthlysettlements.movement_calulated if a new
  currency rate gets valid for the currency the users has chosen to
  display but is different from the currency rate which is stored in
  the DB
    -> field must be recalculated?
    -> why is the shown field saved not the field in the DB currency? is this
       is really the case?
